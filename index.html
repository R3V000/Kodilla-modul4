          I found a love for me Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my
          lead Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet Oh, I never knew you
          were the someone waiting for me
        </p>
        <p>
          'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love Not knowing what it was
          I will not give you up this time But darling, just kiss me slow, your
          heart is all I own And in your eyes, you're holding mine
        </p>
        <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms</p>
        <p>
          Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song When you said
          you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath But you heard it,
          darling, you look perfect tonight
        </p>
        <p>
          Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know She shares my
          dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home I found a love, to
          carry more than just my secrets To carry love, to carry children of
          our own
        </p>
        <p>
          We are still kids, but we're so in love Fighting against all odds I
          know we'll be alright this time Darling, just hold my hand Be my girl,
          I'll be your man I see my future in your eyes
        </p>
        <p>
          Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms Barefoot on
          the grass, listening to our favorite song When I saw you in that
          dress, looking so beautiful I don't deserve this, darling, you look
          perfect tonight
        </p>
        <p>
          Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms Barefoot on
          the grass, listening to our favorite song I have faith in what I see
          Now I know I have met an angel in person And she looks perfect I don't
          deserve this You look perfect tonight
